1. **Facebook's Meta unveils new subscription service, sparking debate over a two-tiered system for users**
Meta has launched a new subscription service, starting at $11.99 per month, which offers features such as protection from impersonation, exclusive stickers and access to account support. Paying subscribers will also have increased visibility and reach, with their content given prominence in search and comments. However, the move has raised questions over whether Facebook is creating a two-tiered system where those who pay are given priority. Critics have accused the company of monetising its inability to prevent account impersonators, while others have claimed the move is a desperate bid to generate revenue.

2. **Exploring the Revolutionary Potential of Quantum Cryptography for Secure Communications**
Quantum cryptography is a revolutionary method of transmitting encrypted data using the principles of quantum mechanics. At its core, quantum cryptography is based on the fact that the mere act of observing a quantum system changes its state. This means that if an eavesdropper attempts to intercept the transmission of quantum-encrypted information, it would alter the state of the system and cause errors that can be detected by the sender and recipient. Quantum cryptography works by using a technique known as quantum key distribution (QKD) to generate an unbreakable encryption key. In QKD, two parties use a series of entangled qubits to create a shared secret key that can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the message.

3. **Store Your Files Forever on YouTube with ISG: The Rust Tool That Embeds Files into Videos**
ISG is a tool written in Rust that enables users to embed files into videos and upload them to YouTube as infinite cloud storage. The program utilizes two modes, RGB and binary, to represent data as pixels and can withstand YouTube's compression by increasing pixel size. The program is available for download via the developer's GitHub repository and can be run on any platform that supports Rust.

4. **7 Habits of Highly Effective Developers: Tips to Boost Your Coding Skills**
A developer has written about seven habits that distinguish highly effective developers. The first is proactivity, where an individual does not let external stimuli derail them and commits to finding solutions. Beginning with the end in mind is another habit, that focuses on setting goals and mapping out a plan. Other habits include putting first things first, thinking win-win and seeking first to understand, then to be understood. The final two habits are to synergise the different parts of a project and to sharpen the saw, or continue improving knowledge and processes.
