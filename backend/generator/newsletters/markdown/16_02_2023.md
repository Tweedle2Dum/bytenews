1. **15 inch Macbook Air rumorede to launch in April**
Apple is expected to launch a new MacBook Air with a 15-inch display size option in "early April," according to Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants. It's unclear whether the new model will be equipped with the M2 or the yet-to-be-announced M3 chip. Apple's chip-making partner TSMC started mass production of 3nm chips in December, but it's unknown if the M3 chip would be ready by April. A spring event is expected to be held by Apple to unveil the new product, as they have done in previous years.

The move comes after Bard made an incorrect statement about the Webb Space Telescope during a recent introduction, reportedly causing Google to lose $100 million in stock price. The company did not clarify whether employees were expected to test the AI every day or over a longer period.
