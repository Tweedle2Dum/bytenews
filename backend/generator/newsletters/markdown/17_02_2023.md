1. **Susan Wojcicki steps down as YouTube CEO after 9 years at the helm**
Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube, is stepping down from her role and will be replaced by Neal Mohan, her longtime lieutenant. During her tenure, YouTube became increasingly important to Google and Alphabet, generating $29.2 billion in ad sales in 2022, more than 10 percent of Alphabetâ€™s total revenue. Wojcicki's departure also has meaningful symbolism for Google and tech, as she has been one of the very few women to operate a huge tech business. She was an integral part of Google's founding and made a point of increasing YouTube's accessibility to advertisers while trying to wrangle its unruly group of video creators.

2. **Twitter's integrity and reliability degraded under Elon Musk's leadership**
Twitter has become increasingly unpredictable since Elon Musk took over in the past four months, according to this article. The site has been hit by major technical glitches, while Musk's erratic decision-making has alienated many users, and degraded the site's core product. One of the most telling signs of Twitter's decline was when Musk reportedly demanded engineers boost his tweets so they appeared at the top of users' For You page, causing many to complain. Researchers also claim that under Musk, there has been a more than 200% increase in anti-black slurs on the site.
