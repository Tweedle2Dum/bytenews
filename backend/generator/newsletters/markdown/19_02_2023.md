1. **Apple Fires Hundreds of Contractors to Cut Costs, Breaking Job Security Promise**
Apple has reportedly fired hundreds of contract workers hired by third-party agencies in a bid to cut costs, according to insiders. The contractors, who worked with Apple employees on various projects, had contracts of up to 15 months with the company. One said Apple had previously assured the workers that their jobs were safe, but the company broke the promise. Apple recently said it is "managing costs very tightly and is curtailing hiring in certain areas while continuing to hire in others."

2. **Roblox Tests AI Tool to Let Players Build In-Game Objects with Natural Language**
Roblox is testing a new tool that uses generative AI to write code for in-game objects. The tool allows players to create items, change their appearance and behavior, and add interactive properties by typing natural language instead of code. The approach shows promise for Roblox as many games on the platform are created by individuals or small teams, and it could speed up the process of building and altering in-game objects. Roblox says the code-making AI it uses relies on a combination of in-house technology and capabilities from outside sources, but it will tread carefully to ensure that users do not object to having their creations fed into generative AI algorithms.

3. **New Malware 'Frebniis' Stealthily Abuses Microsoft IIS Feature to Exfiltrate Data and Execute Malicious Code**
Criminal hackers are using a feature in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) called Failed Request Event Buffering (FREB) to stealthily exfiltrate data and execute malicious code from compromised Windows systems, according to Symantec researchers. The malware, dubbed Frebniis, injects malicious code into the IIS process memory to hijack FREB's execution, allowing it to inspect all HTTP requests received by the server and blend in with legitimate web requests, making it a stealthy method to infiltrate compromised networks.

4. **New Research Suggests Psychedelics May Alter Nerve Cells to Escape Medical Disorders**
Psychedelics may activate serotonin signaling in a unique way that leads to changes in nerve cells, potentially allowing altered inputs, according to new research. Psychedelics such as LSD, mescaline, DMT, and psilocin bind to serotonin receptors and cause the structures that receive input from other nerve cells to grow and branch, which may allow cells to escape whatever network configuration has been associated with a medical disorder. The findings confirm that serotonin signaling is central to these changes.
