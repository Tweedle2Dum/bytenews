                  Susan Wojcicki steps down as YouTube CEO after 9 years at the
                  helm
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube, is stepping down from her
                  role and will be replaced by Neal Mohan, her longtime
                  lieutenant. During her tenure, YouTube became increasingly
                  important to Google and Alphabet, generating $29.2 billion in
                  ad sales in 2022, more than 10 percent of Alphabetâ€™s total
                  revenue. Wojcicki's departure also has meaningful symbolism
                  for Google and tech, as she has been one of the very few women
                  to operate a huge tech business. She was an integral part of
                  Google's founding and made a point of increasing YouTube's
                  accessibility to advertisers while trying to wrangle its
                  unruly group of video creators.

                  Twitter's integrity and reliability degraded under Elon Musk's
                  leadership
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Twitter has become increasingly unpredictable since Elon Musk
                  took over in the past four months, according to this article.
                  The site has been hit by major technical glitches, while
                  Musk's erratic decision-making has alienated many users, and
                  degraded the site's core product. One of the most telling
                  signs of Twitter's decline was when Musk reportedly demanded
                  engineers boost his tweets so they appeared at the top of
                  users' For You page, causing many to complain. Researchers
                  also claim that under Musk, there has been a more than 200%
                  increase in anti-black slurs on the site.

                  Crypto Ecosystem Faces Regulatory Headwinds and Inflation
                  Worries, But Sees Opportunities for Growth in 2023
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Financial markets reacted negatively to inflation numbers
                  slightly higher than expected, but the figures are lower than
                  the previous month. BTC also dipped but has since recovered.
                  Crypto faces regulatory pressures with Paxos' BUSD being
                  scrutinized as a security, and the industry anticipating
                  further scrutiny. Meanwhile, the industry remains resilient,
                  and partnerships are emerging, including a collaborative
                  report with D-Core. Turkey and Syria have received aid from
                  global crypto exchanges, with Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin
                  donating $227K.

                  Unlocking the Power of AI: Understanding Generative AI, Deep
                  Learning and the Future of Software Development
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have become
                  mainstream, with applications in various fields. As big data
                  continues to grow, developers need to equip themselves with
                  the right skills to transform data into actionable business
                  solutions. AI techniques like natural language processing,
                  computer vision, and deep learning can be used to discover
                  patterns, automate processes, and simplify complex tasks.
                  Generative AI is an interesting application of AI that relies
                  on machine learning to generate predictions based on patterns
                  it observes. Software developers who adopt AI technology early
                  on will be indispensable and accomplish more in less time.

                  Tesla to recall 363,000 vehicles over Full Self-Driving
                  software 'crash risk' identified by NHTSA
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Tesla is recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles with Full
                  Self-Driving (FSD) software, based on a directive from the
                  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), after
                  the top federal safety agency identified the driver-assist
                  program as a "crash risk." The recall includes the following
                  vehicles equipped with FSD beta: 2016-2023 Model S and Model
                  X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y. Tesla will push
                  out an over-the-air software update, free of charge, to
                  address the four specific situations identified by NHTSA.
                  Tesla identified 18 warranty claims that may be related to the
                  conditions described.
