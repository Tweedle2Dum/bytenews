                  Facebook's Meta unveils new subscription service, sparking
                  debate over a two-tiered system for users
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Meta has launched a new subscription service, starting at
                  $11.99 per month, which offers features such as protection
                  from impersonation, exclusive stickers and access to account
                  support. Paying subscribers will also have increased
                  visibility and reach, with their content given prominence in
                  search and comments. However, the move has raised questions
                  over whether Facebook is creating a two-tiered system where
                  those who pay are given priority. Critics have accused the
                  company of monetising its inability to prevent account
                  impersonators, while others have claimed the move is a
                  desperate bid to generate revenue.

                  Quantum cryptography is a revolutionary method of transmitting
                  encrypted data using the principles of quantum mechanics. At
                  its core, quantum cryptography is based on the fact that the
                  mere act of observing a quantum system changes its state. This
                  means that if an eavesdropper attempts to intercept the
                  transmission of quantum-encrypted information, it would alter
                  the state of the system and cause errors that can be detected
                  by the sender and recipient. Quantum cryptography works by
                  using a technique known as quantum key distribution (QKD) to
                  generate an unbreakable encryption key. In QKD, two parties
                  use a series of entangled qubits to create a shared secret key
                  that can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages,
                  ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the
                  message.

                <p>
                  ISG is a tool written in Rust that enables users to embed
                  files into videos and upload them to YouTube as infinite cloud
                  storage. The program utilizes two modes, RGB and binary, to
                  represent data as pixels and can withstand YouTube's
                  compression by increasing pixel size. The program is available
                  for download via the developer's GitHub repository and can be
                  run on any platform that supports Rust.

                  A developer has written about seven habits that distinguish
                  highly effective developers. The first is proactivity, where
                  an individual does not let external stimuli derail them and
                  commits to finding solutions. Beginning with the end in mind
                  is another habit, that focuses on setting goals and mapping
                  out a plan. Other habits include putting first things first,
                  thinking win-win and seeking first to understand, then to be
                  understood. The final two habits are to synergise the
                  different parts of a project and to sharpen the saw, or
                  continue improving knowledge and processes.
