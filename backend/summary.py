BLOOM is an open-access multilingual language model that contains 176 billion parameters and was trained for 3.5 months on 384 A100â€“80GB GPUs. A BLOOM checkpoint takes 330 GB of disk space, so it seems unfeasible to run this model on a desktop computer. However, you just need enough disk space, at least 16GB of RAM, and some patience (you don't even need a GPU), to run this model on your computer.
